# LCD Test based on the STM32F103RBT6 microcontroller

# This project currently does nothing more than the template I have, currently very much a WIP >.>

This is a small project designed to test the LCD on an STM32F103RBT6 dev board like [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/STM32F103RBT6-Development-Board-W-2-8-TFT-Module-True-Color-Touch-Screen-Panel-/251075980222?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3a754b6bbe)

I recommend using something like stm32flash for this board, it can be found [here](http://stm32flash.googlecode.com)

Feel free to use it how you want, just let me know if it helps at all :)
